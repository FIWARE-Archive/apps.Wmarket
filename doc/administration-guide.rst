Administration Guide
====================

The WMarket Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be very complex for consumers
(those users who does not create stores or description/offerings). For this
reason, options to create stores and descriptions are hidden by default. 

The proccess to become a provider is very easy and depends on the 
selected authentication system. 


Local Authentication
====================

If the WMarket instance you are administering is based on a local 
authentication system, you do not have to worry about upgrading users to
providers since they can do it by themselves in a very easy way by editing
their prefereces. To do so, users should click on their name and then
click the **Settings** button.

After this they will be redirected to the user settings management page where
a button to become provider can be found.
