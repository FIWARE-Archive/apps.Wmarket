WMarket
=======

WMarket is the reference implementation of the FIWARE Marketplace
Generic Enabler. The Marketplace provides functionality necessary for
bringing together offering and demand for making business. These
functions include basic services for registering business entities,
publishing and retrieving offerings and demands, search and discover
offerings according to specific consumer requirements as well as lateral
functions like review, rating and recommendation. Besides the core
functions, the Marketplace may offer value because of its "knowledge"
about the market in terms of market intelligence services, pricing
support, advertising, information subscription and more.
